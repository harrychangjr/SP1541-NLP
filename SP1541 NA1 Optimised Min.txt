Despite the availability of an effective vaccine, measles cases and deaths continue to surge worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported nearly 10 million cases and over 140,000 deaths from measles in 2018. Measles, a highly contagious disease, can cause severe long-term effects on the immune systems of those affected, making vaccination crucial to protect children from lifelong complications.
Although an effective and cost-efficient vaccine exists, measles outbreaks remain a significant global health issue, particularly in developing countries with limited access to vaccinations and high-quality health infrastructure. A study on the measles outbreak in Pakistan found that optimizing the timing of vaccination campaigns could significantly reduce measles infections.
Senior researcher Niket Thakkar from the Institute for Disease Modeling (USA) led the study in response to the sudden increase in measles cases in Pakistan from 2016 to 2017. With only 61% of toddlers under two vaccinated, Pakistan has one of the highest numbers of unvaccinated infants worldwide.
The research team developed a mathematical model using linear regression to predict the severity of future outbreaks. They analyzed case data from Pakistan, categorized by province, and predicted the number of cases for subsequent months within the next three years. This model helped researchers determine when and where to distribute vaccines within the country.
Results showed that a vaccination campaign in November would have the greatest impact, preventing an estimated 440,000 more infections than a campaign in January. The Pakistani government used these findings to plan their vaccination campaign in November 2018. Consequently, the estimated measles vaccination coverage in infants under two increased to 73% nationwide.
The study revealed a low transmission season from May to October, which highlights the importance of implementing the campaign in November when cases start to surge again. Delaying the campaign from November 2018 to May 2019 would have resulted in over 600,000 additional infections.
To prevent future outbreaks, countries must invest in high-quality immunization programs and disease surveillance. Ensuring access to high-quality vaccination programs in even the poorest countries is crucial to prevent unnecessary loss of lives to easily treatable diseases like measles.
